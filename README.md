# Google Meet Attendees
This script is currently far from finished

It relies heavily on the Google Meet Grid View script/extension so that is required for it to work.

If you want to install it as a userscript here is [the link.](https://github.com/C4illin/Google-Meet-Attendees/raw/master/copy.simple.user.js)

Or install [crx3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/crx3) and build it into a chrome extension with pack.bat (not recommended)

## List of features 
* Get all attendees and sort them
* Compare attendees with a list
* Randomize attendee

# Google Meet Attendees
This script is currently far from finished but the current prototype is working and open for installation.

It relies heavily on the Google Meet Grid View script/extension so that is required for it to work.

## Install
* Chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/olmgpgbhojeoalaimckcpgkadjkejacl/

* Userscript: https://github.com/C4illin/Google-Meet-Attendees/raw/master/copy.simple.user.js

Make sure you have Google Meet Grid View installed!
